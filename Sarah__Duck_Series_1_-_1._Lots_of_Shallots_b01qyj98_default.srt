1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,360
QUACK!

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,280
# Sarah and Duck

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,120
QUACK!

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,720
# Sarah and Duck

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,880
QUACK!

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,200
# Sarah and Duck. #

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,240
QUACK!

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,000
This morning, Sarah and Duck are reading the newspaper.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well, at least Sarah is.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,200
Ooh!

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,560
Ooh. You dropped something there.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,600
QUACK!

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,560
QUACK!

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,400
Oh!

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,480
What are they?

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,920
Seeds.

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,800
They sound...small.

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,960
Why not plant them and see what grows?

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,120
OK. Come on, Duck.

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,160
Is it not better to grow them in the back garden?

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,160
No. We will see them more here.

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,920
Quite right. Carry on.

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,960
Here?

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,960
Duck seems to approve.

25
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,880
QUACK!

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,240
Thank you, Duck.

27
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,640
Not wasting any time, are you?

28
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,680
No.

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,160
DUCK QUACKS

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,840
Take a seed, Duck.

31
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,880
QUACK!

32
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,840
One, two, three.

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,080
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

34
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,480
QUACK! QUACK!

35
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,840
Finished.

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,720
Job well done.

37
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,680
Oh. Ugh.

38
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,920
Well, you are covered, Sarah.

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,360
QUACK!

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,200
You too, Duck!

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,080
Ugh. Muddy Duck.

42
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,120
Come on, let's clean up.

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,520
DUCK QUACKS

44
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,880
QUACK! QUACK!

45
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,000
QUACK! QUACK!

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,360
Aren't ducks supposed to like water?

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,600
SHE GIGGLES

48
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,200
Anything happening yet?

49
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,960
No, not yet.

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,320
Oh, dear. How about some dinner?

51
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,880
OK.

52
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,120
So, what else are you doing today?

53
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,160
Waiting.

54
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,280
Oh?

55
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,400
For the seeds to grow.

56
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,680
You know it could take a while.

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,720
That's OK.

58
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,200
THEY YAWN

59
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,960
SHE SIGHS

60
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,680
Oh, dear. Perhaps if you go to bed, it might happen faster.

61
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,560
Morning, Sarah.

62
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,080
Morning.

63
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,240
- Hello. 
- Hello. 
- Hello! 
- Ahoy!

64
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,280
Ooh. Hello.

65
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,640
They must be onions, though they don't look quite big enough.

66
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,240
They're onion children!

67
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,320
Mmm. Maybe they still need a little bit longer to grow.

68
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Well, we can help them grow.

69
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,800
Great idea. How are you going to do that?

70
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,840
Teach them things.

71
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,200
Hmm. Need to warm up first.

72
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,280
Come on.

73
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,000
- ONIONS: 
- Hup, hup, hup!

74
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,920
Rolly...over.

75
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,200
ONIONS CHEER

76
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,960
QUACK!

77
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,720
- ONIONS: 
- Hup, hup, hup!

78
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,880
QUACK!

79
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,000
Duck...jump!

80
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,240
- ONIONS: 
- Hey! Ho! Hup!

81
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,200
DUCK QUACKS

82
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,920
Ooh, your vegetable book.

83
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,400
Root vege-tables grow from their roots

84
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,280
all the way up out of the ground.

85
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,400
Here are some root vege-tables.

86
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,760
Carrot?

87
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,440
- ONIONS: 
- Yes!

88
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,880
Turnip?

89
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,080
- ONIONS: 
- Turnip!

90
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,640
Marrow.

91
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,280
- ONIONS: 
- No, no! Ew!

92
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,320
Turnip!

93
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,200
OK, now draw your favourites.

94
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,200
Hmm!

95
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,160
- Turnip! 
- Turnip! 
- Turnip! 
- Quack!

96
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,960
Not a bad likeness!

97
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,040
QUACK!

98
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,120
Looks like Professor Duck has some teaching to do.

99
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,040
Maybe some flying lessons?

100
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,240
QUACK!

101
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,120
- ONIONS: 
- Ooh! Ah!

102
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,320
There you go, everything you need.

103
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,360
QUACK!

104
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,040
- ONIONS: 
- Turnip! Turnip! Turnip!

105
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,520
QUACK!

106
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,600
- Oops! 
- SHE GASPS

107
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,960
Shh!

108
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,800
THEY LAUGH

109
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh, look at the book! Those vegetables seem familiar.

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,320
They're shallots.

111
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:06,400
"Shallots are like baby onions and won't grow any bigger."

112
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,160
They're meant to be small!

113
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,880
- SHALLOTS: 
- Yep!

114
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,000
Easy mistake to make.

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,720
Besides, you shallots may have learned a thing or two.

116
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,800
- Thank you. 
- Thank you. 
- Thank you.

117
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,000
Cheers!

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That's OK.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,760
- SHALLOTS: 
- Drums, drums!

120
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,720
- SHALLOTS: 
- Hup, hup, hup!

121
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,320
- SHALLOTS: 
- Thank you!

122
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,800
Thank you!

123
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,400
- Thank you! 
- Thank you!

124
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,720
QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!

125
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,160
QUACK!

126
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,600
- SHALLOTS: 
- Cheers!

127
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,400
Hooray! Well done.

128
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,760
# Sarah and Duck

129
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,800
QUACK!

130
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,200
# Sarah and Duck

131
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,160
QUACK!

132
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,800
# Sarah and Duck

133
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,680
QUACK!

134
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,280
# Sarah and Duck. #

135
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,320
QUACK!
