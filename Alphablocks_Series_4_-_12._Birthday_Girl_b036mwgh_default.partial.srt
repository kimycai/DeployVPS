00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:57,040
.

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,640
# We can laugh ha-ha We can sing la-la-la-la

3
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,040
# We can make anything

4
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,240
# Hold my hand

5
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,200
# Make a magical land

6
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,560
# When letters get together we go alakazam

7
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,320
# We can run, we can slide We can hide in a box

8
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,760
# Are you ready for some fun with the Alphablocks?

9
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,120
# Alphablocks! #

10
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
G, G, G, G.

11
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,080
I'm growing my hair for the party.

12
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,240
Oooh, it's lovely and long!

13
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,280
Ready, everyone? It's party time...

14
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,920
- But whose party is it? 
- I know!

15
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,520
Let's find out... IR,

16
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,800
IR-IR-IRIR.

17
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,080
- G. 
- IR.

18
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,920
- L. 
- Girl!

19
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,560
- Hello! 
- ALL: Hello, Girl. We're having a party.

20
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,680
A party? I love parties.

21
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,920
- Whose party is it? 
- Yours!

22
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,840
A party for me!

23
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,960
But I want lots and lots and lots of friends for my party.

24
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,960
SHE WHISTLES

25
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,400
Ha-ha, hiya!

26
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,640
No, I mean lots and lots and lots more than that.

27
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,080
SHE WHISTLES MORE LOUDLY

28
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,160
Aaaah! A!

29
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,160
That's better.

30
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,160
Everybody, hold hands.

31
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,080
BIRTHDAY!

32
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,600
It's your birthday party.

33
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Happy birthday!

34
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,280
Yay!

35
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,720
First, we need to make a birthday cake!

36
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,720
- Yummy! 
- We need eggs, flour, sugar and butter...

37
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,680
(and a pinch of fairy dust.)

38
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,640
Then you stir it all up.

39
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,880
STIR!

40
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,160
Stir! Stir! Stir!

41
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,840
Stir! Stir! Stir!

42
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,360
SHE GIGGLES Sticky, messy fun!

43
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,040
Now for the best bit. SHE WHISTLES

44
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,440
- QU! 
- We need to decorate my birthday cake.

45
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,720
Everybody, hold hands.

46
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,400
SQUIRT!

47
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,720
Squirt! Squirt! Squirt!

48
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,480
Squirt! Squirt! Squirt! Squirt!

49
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,200
A squidgy, squirty mess!

50
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,720
SHE GIGGLES

51
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,040
Sticky-yuck-yuck. Ha, ha!

52
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,640
I need some new birthday clothes!

53
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,800
SKIRT!

54
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,160
I love my new skirt. Now it's time for...

55
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,040
party games!

56
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,200
- We need music. 
- Band!

57
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,840
Let's play musical statues.

58
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,080
W-What do we have to do?

59
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,640
I'll show you.

60
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,160
When the music plays, you have to move about like this.

61
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,960
Tra-la-la-la-la...

62
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,600
When it stops, you freeze.

63
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,720
Well done. Ready, everyone?

64
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,760
MUSIC PLAYS

65
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,280
Freeze!

66
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,560
TWIRL!

67
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,560
EVERYONE LAUGHS

68
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,640
Ooooh! I said freeze.

69
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,040
It's time for birthday presents.

70
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,320
Eh?!

71
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,000
- Have we got a present? 
- Ah!

72
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,920
This is a special cake, birthday girl.

73
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,960
When you blow out the candles,

74
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,640
- you can make a wish. 
- A wish!

75
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,160
# Happy birthday, happy birthday Girl

76
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,240
# You can wish for anything in the world. #

77
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,800
I wish... I wish...

78
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,760
SHE TAKES A DEEP BREATH

79
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,920
Phooooo!

80
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,560
- Open your eyes, birthday girl. 
- Ha!

81
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,040
BIRD!

82
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,640
TWEETING

83
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,240
A bird! I'm flying on a bird! I love birds.

84
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,520
Oooh, this is the best birthday ever!

85
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,040
SHE LAUGHS

86
